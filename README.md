# stbgcc-8.5 (Zappware NV Fork)
GCC 8.5 based releases (stbgcc) (Zappware NV Fork)

This is an unofficial fork of Broadcoms' [stbgcc-8.3-2.0](https://github.com/Broadcom/stbgcc-8.3/releases/tag/stbgcc-8.3-2.0)

It was forked by Zappware NV Belgium because compiling WPEWebkit triggered various ICEs (Internal Compiler Error).

Many ICE bugs/regressions were fixed in gcc 8.4 and 8.5. Therefore we upgraded GCC to 8.5 here. We also ported all existing patches from Broadcoms' stbgcc-8.3-2.0 release.

Note: No QA validation was done for this repository and neither Broadcom nor Zappware will accept any responsibility nor offer any support for this version. Use it at your own risk!
